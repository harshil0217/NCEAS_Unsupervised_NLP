# NCEAS_Unsupervised_NLP
NCEAS Project for SS26 Data Science Capstone

## Objective
The objective of the NCEAS_Unsupervised_NLP project is to support the development of improved methods for unsupervised analysis of unstructured textual data in the context of discourse and narratives surrounding US fisheries, particularly the ecologial and social dynamics surrounding commericial fishing and government regulation.

## Key Components
### Text Scraping and Data Collection
We will develop a Python API to scrape textfrom audio transcriptions of fisheries podcasts and related unstructured text from public forums related to US fisheries. The collected data will then be stored in a structured database for analysis.

### NLP and Data Modeling
The project will employ natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the textual data. Advancements in textual embeddings enabled by large language models (LLMs) will be explored

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization
Visualizations will play a crucial role in representing the analysis and communicating results to fisheries researchers and expert NLP practitioners

### Analysis and Quantification
The team will apply a few standard and emerging methods for dimensionality reduction and hierarchical clustering to textual embeddings with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art. The results will be compared through robust statistical analysis. Metrics will include the adjusted Rand index (ARI), mutual information (MI), the Fowlkes–Mallows index (FM), and others as identified by the team.
